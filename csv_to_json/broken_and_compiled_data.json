    "Notes": "VPN/Proxy Detection: Identified by sites as a proxy in addition to three of the assigned IP addresses are leased by Strong Technology. Configuration: Of note is that the destination IP addresses from the host computer are the same IP addresses that are forwarded to the web by the VPN. Anyone monitoring may detect the host computer's origin. IP Ownership: Again, concern that many IP addresses were directly owned by Strong Technology."
